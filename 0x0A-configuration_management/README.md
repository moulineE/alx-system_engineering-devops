## Project Description

Welcome to the Configuration Management project! In this project, we will explore the world of configuration management using Puppet. Configuration management is a crucial aspect of DevOps and system administration, and Puppet is a powerful tool that helps automate and manage the configuration of servers and infrastructure.

### Background Context

This project is inspired by a real-world scenario where a system administrator encountered a critical issue due to a misconfiguration. The administrator inadvertently shut down a significant portion of their infrastructure, causing a major service disruption. Fortunately, Puppet came to the rescue, allowing them to quickly restore the environment. This project aims to teach you the importance of proper configuration management and how tools like Puppet can save the day.

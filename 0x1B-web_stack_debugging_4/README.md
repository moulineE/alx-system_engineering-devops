## Tasks

### 0. Sky is the limit, let's bring that limit higher

**Description:** In this web stack debugging task, we are testing the performance of our web server setup featuring Nginx. The current setup is experiencing a significant number of failed requests. The benchmarking is done using ApacheBench to simulate HTTP requests. The goal is to fix the stack to reduce failed requests to 0. Logs are emphasized as valuable tools for debugging.

#### Benchmarking Before Fix

```bash
root@0a62aa706eb3:/# ab -c 100 -n 2000 localhost/
```

#### Puppet Apply

```bash
root@0a62aa706eb3:/# puppet apply 0-the_sky_is_the_limit_not.pp
```

#### Benchmarking After Fix

```bash
root@0a62aa706eb3:/# ab -c 100 -n 2000 localhost/
```

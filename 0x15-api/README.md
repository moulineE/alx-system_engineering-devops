# 0x15. API Project

Welcome to the 0x15 API project! This project involves creating Python scripts to access employee data via an API, organize and export the data into different data structures like CSV and JSON. It's a great opportunity to transition from old-school Bash scripting to more efficient Python scripting.

## Background Context

In this era of modern system administration, system reliability engineers (SREs) are not just limited to Bash scripting. They have embraced more versatile programming languages. APIs are a popular way to expose applications and datasets, enabling interaction with outsiders to access and modify data. In this project, we access employee data via an API and organize it using Python scripts.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand when to use Bash scripting and when to use Python.
- Explain what an API is.
- Understand REST APIs.
- Comprehend microservices.
- Work with data formats like CSV and JSON.
- Write clean and Pythonic code.

## Project Details

This project is divided into several tasks:

### Task 0: Gather data from an API

Write a Python script that retrieves information about an employee's TODO list progress via a REST API.

### Task 1: Export to CSV

Extend the Python script from Task 0 to export data in CSV format.

### Task 2: Export to JSON

Extend the Python script from Task 0 to export data in JSON format.

### Task 3: Dictionary of list of dictionaries

Extend the Python script from Task 0 to create a dictionary of tasks for all employees and export it in JSON format.

## Requirements

- All Python files should be compatible with Python 3.8.5.
- Organize your code following PEP8 style guides.
- Make your code clean and readable.
- Use the pycodestyle tool for style checking.
- Provide documentation for your modules.
- Do not execute code when imported (use `if __name__ == "__main__":`).
- Use alphabetical order for libraries and modules.
- Allow your files to be executed.
- Use `get` to access dictionary values.
- End all files with a new line.
- The first line of all your files should be `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- Use the allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- The README.md file at the project's root is mandatory.

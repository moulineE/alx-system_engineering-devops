## Project Description

The "API Advanced" project involves working with the Reddit API to accomplish various tasks, such as retrieving the number of subscribers for a subreddit, listing the titles of hot posts, and creating a recursive function to collect all hot articles for a given subreddit.

## Project Tasks
0. 
1. **How Many Subs?**
   - Write a function to query the Reddit API and return the number of subscribers for a given subreddit.
   - If the subreddit is invalid, return 0.
   
1. **Top Ten**
   - Write a function to query the Reddit API and print the titles of the first 10 hot posts for a given subreddit.
   - If the subreddit is invalid, print "None."
   
2. **Recurse It!**
   - Write a recursive function to query the Reddit API and return a list of titles of all hot articles for a given subreddit.
   - If no results are found for the subreddit, return "None."

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Interpretation on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python3 (version 3.4.3)
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- Organize imported libraries in alphabetical order
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
- Code should adhere to the PEP 8 style guide
- All files must be executable
- File lengths will be tested using `wc`
- All modules should have proper documentation using `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)`
- Use the `Requests` module for making HTTP requests to the Reddit API

## Usage

To test the functions for querying the Reddit API, you can run the provided test scripts.
